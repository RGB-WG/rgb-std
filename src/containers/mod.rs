//! RGB containers are data packages which can be transferred between smart
//! contract users. There are two main types of containers:
//! 1. [`Consignment`]s, containing information about partial state of a *single
//!    contract*, extending from its genesis up to certain contract endpoints.
//! 2. [`Disclosure`]s, containing extracts from (possibly) independent state
//!    transitions and extensions under multiple contracts. Useful fro
//!    disclosing the concealed state for some other parties, and also for
//!    performing "change" operations on inventory during state transfers.
