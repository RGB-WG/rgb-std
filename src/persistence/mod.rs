//! Module defines API used by providers of persistent data for RGB contracts.
//!
//! These data include:
//! 1. Stash: a consensus-critical data for client-side-validation which must be preserved and
//!    backed up.
//! 2. Contract state, updated with each enclosed consignment and disclosure.
//! 3. Index over stash, which simplifies construction of new consignments.
//!
//! Contract state and index data can be re-computed from the stash in case of
//! loss or corruption, while stash can't be recovered unless it was backed up.
